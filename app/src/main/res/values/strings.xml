    <string name="mock_scripture">2 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from
        the east came to Jerusalem 2 and asked, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his
        star when it rose and have come to worship him.” 3 When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all
        Jerusalem with him. 4 When he had called together all the people’s chief priests and teachers of the law, he
        asked them where the Messiah was to be born. 5 “In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the
        prophet has written: 6 “‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of
        Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’” 7 Then Herod called the Magi
        secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. 8 He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go
        and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship
        him.” 9 After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went
        ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. 10 When they saw the star, they were
        overjoyed. 11 On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped
        him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. 12 And
        having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.
